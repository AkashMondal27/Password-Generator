## 📂 Project Structure

PASSWORD GENERATOR GITHUB

├── index.html # Main HTML file

├── style.css # Styling and themes

└── README.md # Project documentation



## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User selects the password length  
2. User chooses at least one character type  
3. JavaScript generates a random password  
4. Password is shuffled for better randomness
